Scraping the top list of books based on Genres from Goodreads(a subsidiary of Amazon)
I have picked Goodreads website to scrape

I'd like to scrape the list of books under each Genre

Project Outline
Step 1:

We're going to scrape Goodreads web site https://www.goodreads.com/list?ref=nav_brws_lists

We'll get a list of genres and its url first save it to a csv.

For each genre we'll get different book list types, no. of books and no. of voters.

For each Genre we got the first 30 book lists with their titles, url with number of books available and voters and saved it to a csv

Step 2:

We selected Childrens Genre and got the first 30 book list types and the first 100 books under each book list type

Each book will have the book title, Book url, Author, Avg Rating Total ratings, Book score and votes

Sved it into a csv file

Step 3:

For each booklist type we'll create a CSV file in the following format:

Format: Book Title,Book url ,Author ,Average rating and Total Ratings ,Bookscore and votes

Example: Harry Potter series box set,https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/862041.Harry_Potter_Series_Box_Set, J.K Rowling, 4.74 avg rating ‚ 273,511 Total ratings ,score:10,671,and 110 peoplevoted

Step 4:

Getting the description took a lot of time so I took a particular genre Children and took a particular book list Best series under Childrens Genre and got descriptions only for those to save time and saved it into a csv file

Step 5:

Now using while loop and for loop i want to scrape book details from atleast first 3 pages under Childrens Genre and Booklist type: Picture books and save it to a csv file
